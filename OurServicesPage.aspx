            <h3>Implants</h3>
            <p>
                Dental Implants or ‘Screw in teeth’ are small titanium screws which has been created to replace the root of your missing teeth enabling the restoration of a tooth in the place of the missing tooth.
          The titanium screw, dental implant, will integrate fully with the jaw bone creating a stable environment for placing a crown.
          You may only need a single dental implant or you may need multiple dental implants dependent on your oral needs. Dental Implants are one of the most effective, safe and predictable solutions for patients who are missing teeth.

            <h3>Root Canal Treatments</h3>
            <p>
                Root Canal Treatments or Endodontic treatment has only one objective that has not changed since the first ever root canal procedure was performed, that is the removal of a root.

            Endodontists strive for the prevention of apical periodontitis so that when a root canal is performed the patient achieves complete healing with no infection, This will enable the dentist to provide the patient with a post and crown so that the damaged tooth is fully restored and help the preservation of the patients jawbone.

            Treating teeth with problems that require root canals has always been a challenge for Dublin endodontists but with the help of state of the art equipment we know that we can now provide a higher rate of success for patient requiring our endodontic services. Our goal is help patients satisfy their main objective which is to have healthy and beautiful teeth.

            <h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
            <p>
                The average persons desire for an attractive smile has become so intense that we have seen an explosion of teeth whitening products available without prescription.

                One of these is a “whitening on the go” which is being sold in pharmacies and corner shops. This type of product is inexpensive to the consumer but they have varying degrees of success for the user but with so many people wanting whiter smiles on the cheap this type of product is selling lots of units.

                Now, the traditional in-chair teeth whitening provided by a dentist is a service that the patients in Dublin are looking for as it does away with the need and fuss of wearing trays at home or having paint liquid on their teeth. The In-Chair Whitening is far more effective.

                The goal for the patient is to have a whiter smile which looks healthier than their current smile, so In-Chair Whitening or home whitening the goal is the same, improving their smile.
