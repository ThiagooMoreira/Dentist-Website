                    Tooth whitening is a procedure that should be carried out by a dentist only. There are many reasons for this. Hydrogen peroxide is a substance that should be handled with care and this should only be done by a qualified dentist. Any staining on your teeth may be due to an underlying condition and your dentist may diagnose this.

                    Absolutely! Normal brushing doesn't clean in between the teeth fully. The most common and effective way of doing this is by flossing. The dental floss removes the plaque between teeth. It is important flossing is carried out correctly, and regularly, at least once a day. You should get your dentist to demonstrate for you. Some patients may need to use other methods, like small brushes that fit between the teeth, particularly if the spaces between the teeth are bigger than normal. Your dentist will advise you on the method most suitable for you.

                    Crowns are special caps that are custom made to fit your tooth. They are normally placed on teeth that are broken down or had been decayed and may already have had a root canal treatment. 
                    Sometimes the crown may come loose or even fall off. This can possibly happen if there is a problem underneath the crown such as decay or if the tooth has been traumatised.
                    It is important to make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. If you cannot get to the dentist immediately here are some tips:
                    - It is a good idea to hold onto to the crown whether it’s a temporary or permanent crown. 
                    - If the tooth is sensitive the use of a fluoride toothpaste will help by rubbing some toothpaste onto the tooth.
                    - As a temporary measure until you visit your dentist you can also place some temporary filling material over the tooth to help the sensitivity. 
                    Don’t place pain killing tablets on the site of the tooth or its gum as it can cause burns to the gum. If the tooth is painful to bite on the use over-the-counter painkillers may help until you see your dentist.
